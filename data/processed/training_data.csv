In this video an AI Warehouse agent named Albert learns how to walk to escape 5 rooms I created. The AI was trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a method of Machine Learning which involves rewarding the agent for doing something correctly, and punishing it for doing anything incorrectly. Albert's actions are controlled by a Neural Network that's updated after each attempt in order to try to give Albert more rewards and less punishments over time.

Suppose that the data mining task is to cluster points into three clusters, where the points are
A1(2, 10), A2(2, 5), A3(8, 4), B1(5, 8), B2(7, 5), B3(6, 4), C1(1, 2), C2(4, 9).
The distance function is Euclidean distance. 
Suppose initially we assign A1, B1, and C1 as the center of each cluster, respectively.

How I Learned This: https://nnfs.io/ (by the awesome @sentdex )

I'm not an AI expert by any means, I probably have made some mistakes. So I apologise in advance :)

Also, I only used PyTorch to test the forward pass. Apart from that, everything else is written in pure Python (+ use of Numpy).

In this video, we learn how Python allows us to change the behavior of operators (like +, -, *, /, **, etc.) when they are used with class objects. Rather than performing normal arithmetic, we can customize what these operators do when they interact with objects of our own classes.

Chips, models, platforms — if it had “AI” in the name, it soared. But today, reality checked the hype. Big-tech stocks plunged and global markets followed — wiping out $730 billion in a single day. The trigger? Michael Burry — the man who predicted the 2008 crash — just placed a massive bet against AI stocks, echoing fears of a bubble. Is this the end of AI euphoria?

He says that artificial intelligence could one day outsmart and overpower its creators. Hinton warns that tech giants are moving too fast, that global cooperation is needed, and that we may need a “Chernobyl moment” to take the danger seriously. From mass job losses to loss of control, Hinton says humanity’s survival depends on how we act now.
