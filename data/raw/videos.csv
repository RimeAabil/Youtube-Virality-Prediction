In this video an AI Warehouse agent named Albert learns how to walk to escape 5 rooms I created. The AI was trained using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a method of Machine Learning which involves rewarding the agent for doing something correctly, and punishing it for doing anything incorrectly. Albert's actions are controlled by a Neural Network that's updated after each attempt in order to try to give Albert more rewards and less punishments over time.

How I Learned This: https://nnfs.io/ (by the awesome @sentdex )

I'm not an AI expert by any means, I probably have made some mistakes. So I apologise in advance :)

Also, I only used PyTorch to test the forward pass. Apart from that, everything else is written in pure Python (+ use of Numpy).
